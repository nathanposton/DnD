Oath of the Breathless

Description: ------------------------------------------------------------------

The Oath of the Breathless is known to few, and is usually a calling from
birth. When deemed ready, paladins are presented with the path by cold servants
of truth: djinn of air and ice, the immortal dragon Bahamut, or even the great
Torm himself.

Paladins of this order oppose deceit above all else, and do so violently.
In token of their willingness to never again utter a lie, they forsake breath
itself, becoming one of the Breathless. In place of vocal exhalations, they
begin to exude the icy aura of Bahamut himself which grows with the strength of
their conviction. By the force of their will, they use the emanation
to oppress the deceitful with icy fervor.

Tenets of Devotion: -----------------------------------------------------------

Honesty:
    - To lie explicitly is unthinkable, perhaps impossible.
    - You vow truth above all else, as clear cold and hard as possible, in your
      every thought.
    - You vow to enforce such in the world around you.

Justice:
    - Uphold the law and enforce it among others, as doing so makes one an
      honest soul.

Compassion:
    - The oppressed are driven to dishonesty by desperation. Alleviate their
      burdens so they too may strive for truth.

Special Features (3rd Level): -------------------------------------------------

- If Dragonborn, your breath weapon is replaced with an aura blast. The
  mechanics of this ability are the same as the breath weapon being replaced,
  except that any damage applied becomes either air or ice elemental type.
- The verbal component of all spells is no longer necessary for you.
- You can (and do) hold your breath indefinitely.
- Any effect based on breathing has no effect on you (negative or positive).
- Once per long rest, you can perform the levitate spell on yourself only.

Channel Divinity: -------------------------------------------------------------

- Breathless Rebuke: As a bonus action, steal the breath of any number of
  creatures within 120ft until your next turn. These creatures become silenced,
  and must perform concentration saving throw if applicable.
- Armed with Truth: As a bonus action, choose a weapon. For 1 minute, add your
  charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon. Add 1d6 ice or air
  damage to successful attacks multiplied by the highest level unused spell slot
  available (minimum 1). That spell slot is only used to determine the
  multiplier, it is not expended.

Oath Features: ----------------------------------------------------------------

7th Level:
Oppressive Truth:
- When making a charisma check you make against a
  creature, add the deception proficiency (not including Charisma modifier) of
  that creature to your roll. Alternatively, a creature making a Charisma check
  or saving throw against you subtracts their deception proficiency (but not
  general Charisma) from their roll. This only applies once (i.e. should a spell
  be cast that uses a charisma modifier to determine DC, while also requiring a
  charisma saving throw, this feature can be applied either to the saving throw
  or to the DC but not to both, and must be applied prior to the DM's
  announcement of their roll result).
- Additionally, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you cannot be
  charmed and have advantage against all illusion magic. Upon a critical success
  save against an illusion spell, you may choose to permanently silence the
  caster if within sight or hearing range. The radius for this
  increases to 30ft at the 18th level.
Cognitive Dissonance:
- If you or your party intentionally use illusion or enchantment spells with
  the 'social' tag (except Zone of Truth) by casting spell or by using a
  potion or a scroll, your Charisma immediately drops to 10 until you complete
  a long rest.

15th Level:

Brutal Honesty:
- Starting at 15th level, you can manifest your unyielding conviction to
  physically dominate your foes with air and wind. As a bonus action, you can
  grapple and shove at a range of up to 15 feet. Add your Charisma modifier to
  your DC for these actions.
- Additionally, you gain resistance to cold and air damage. Anytime you have
  resistance to either or both elements from another source, you become immune
  to the resisted element or elements. Anytime you have immunity to either or
  both elements from another source, as a reaction you can redirect the attack
  elsewhere. In this case, you must make your own rolls (such as attack rolls)
  and calculate DC's using your own attributes.
Immediate retribution:
- Starting at 15th level, deliberate deception temporarily strips you of your
  immunity to suffocation. Because you no longer breath, this  results in
  immediate unconsciousness. Immunity returns with the loss of consciousness.

20th Level:

The Accuser:
- At 20th level, as an action you can manifest your true nature as a harbinger of
  Torm's just condemnation. You take on a special form, appearing as an ice
  dragon of the same size as your current stature. You can move as an ice dragon
  (such as fly with the same speed) and gain temporary hit points equal to your
  current hit points. Additionally, you gain truesight. Finally, you emanate an
  aura of frigid shame within a 30 foot radius. Enemies within your aura must
  succeed on a constitution saving throw or be racked with guilt. Celestials,
  fiends, and constructs are immune to guilt. Guilty enemies cannot move or
  breath, and have disadvantage on all attacks. You retain your form for 1 hour,
  until you dismiss the form, or until you lose your temporary hit points. Once
  you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.
